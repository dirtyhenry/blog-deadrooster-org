With some friends of us, we made up a very cool game : "elect the songs that would compose the best 80 minutes of music ever".

The rules are simple : 
-* don't pick more than one song for a single artist
-* try not to pick the best song of each of your favorite bands, just pick the best songs ever ! (who cares the band has made only one good song !!!). 

Here is the first draft of my list : (that can evolve, of course)

-# Autour de Lucie's - *Selon l'humeur*
-# The Strokes - Last nite
-# Franz Ferdinand - *Take me out*
-# Pixies - *Caribou*
-# Pulp - *Common people*
-# The Beach Boys - *God only knows*
-# The Kinks - *Milk cow blues*
-# Nada Surf - *Hi-speed soul*
-# M - *Nostalgic du cool*
-# The Clash - *Clash city rockers*
-# David Bowie - *Space oddity*
-# Blondie - *Atomic*
-# Oasis - *Fade away* (the version from a War Child compilation)
-# Deep Purple - *Highway star*
-# Led Zeppelin - *Rock and roll*
-# Björk - *Bachelorette*
-# The Libertines - *Vertigo*
-# Hot Hot Heat - *No, not now*
-# The Velvet Underground - *I'll be your mirror*
-# Roger Glover and Butterfly Balls - *Love is all*
-# Blur - *Song 2*
-# Sleeper - *Twisted*

Up to you to build your own list.
