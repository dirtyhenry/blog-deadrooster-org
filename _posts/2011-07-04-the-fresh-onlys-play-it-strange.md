One month ago, Dead Rooster was in Barcelona for the Primavera Festival. This very friday, in the middle afternoon, Joe Gantdelaine and I were sitting in the Parc Central del Poblenou, a satellite stage of the festival. There, we have grass rather than concrete but unexplicably, the vast majority of the festival audience snubs it. A San Miguel cup in hand, comfortably seated in plastic garden chairs, in the shade of the surrounding trees, we watched the concert of the Fresh & Onlys, the authors of the recent {Play It Strange}. The concert convinced us to get it.

The record starts with a charming lightness song, {Summer Of Love}. Clean guitars and heavy reverb for the lead singing voice makes it an easy and seducing introduction, in an atmosphere caribbeanized by organs, xylophones and bongas. The second track is a different gear: high-pitched vocals, the bass leads the way while the guitar keeps playing this simple but terrific riff that concludes the best song of the album, {Waterfall}, [that you might have already seen here->706].

If Lee Mavers was twenty years younger, was taking anti-depressants and Frosties for breakfast, was born in San Fransico and spent more time at the beach, The La's would be called The Fresh & Onlys. Of course, the comparison is completely stupid, but let's face it: same taste for the coolest possible folk ({Until The End Of Time}, {Red Light, Green Light}), same mix of perfect pop songs ({Waterfall} for sure, but {Be My Hooker} and {Plague Of Frogs} as well) and epic titles ({Tropical Island Suite}).

It may sound too wise to be a great record, but Fresh & Onlys can also be weird and crazy as in {Who Needs A Man}, which does make {Play It Strange} the best record we've listened to for a while. And, unlike The La's, The Fresh & Onlys release a lot of stuff : {Play It Strange} is already the third album of the band. We should try to get {The Fresh & Onlys} and {Grey-Eyed Girls}, the two previous albums, as fast as we can.

Let me conclude by this nice anecdote about the fact that [people should buy vinyle records again->849]. Plus it proves the band is really cool. A few minutes after the concert ended, i went close to the stage to ask the band if they could sell me their record. The guitarist nodded and gave me the 12" record saying: "we sell these 20 euros at the festival but right now, just name your price and it will be fine". The deal was set for 12 euros, MP3-download-coupon and hand-shake included.
